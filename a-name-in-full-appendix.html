    <sup>1</sup>Following a proposal by poet and founder of City Lights
    Books Lawrence Ferlinghetti, on January 25, 1988, twelve San
    Francisco streets or parts of streets were renamed for artists and
    writers. Eleven are listed above; the twelfth, Via Bufano, was named
    for Beniamino Bufano. Ferlinghetti had also proposed renaming Nobles
    Alley in North Beach for Richard Brautigan, but the residents of
    Nobles Alley objected. Ferlinghetti got his own street, Via
    Ferlinghetti, in 1994, but, like Bufano, didn't get a place on this
    list.<br>
    <br>
    <sup>2</sup>All three of these streets in the St. Francis Square
    housing project, which was founded by the ILWU, are named not after
    individuals, but ships which were themselves named after
    individuals.<br>
    <br>
    <sup>3</sup>These streets are signed (whether by the DPW or not) and
    appear on some maps, but do not appear in DPW mapping data so may
    not have the same official status as the other streets listed. Most
    of these names are honorary, meaning that they did not replace the
    previous names but augmented them, and are not registered with the
    U.S. Post Office.<br>
