    <p>Tandang Sora Street, between 3rd, 4th, Folsom and Harrison, is named for
      the Filipina revolutionary Melchora Aquino, but does not bear her full
      name; "Tandang Sora" is an epithet referring to her advanced age (84) at
      the time of the Phillipine Revolution.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup>Following a proposal by poet and founder of City Lights
      Books Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofjanaprproceed83sanfrich/page/88/mode/2up?view=theater">in 1988, twelve San Francisco streets or parts of streets were renamed for thirteen artists and writers.</a>

      Ten are listed above. Saroyan and Via Bufano were renamed for William
      Saroyan (oddly omitting his given name, though Loewenstein and many other
      sources incorrectly name the street in full) and Beniamino Bufano. Nobles
      Alley in North Beach was to be renamed for Richard Brautigan, but the
      residents of Nobles Alley objected. Ferlinghetti got his own street, Via
      Ferlinghetti, in 1994, but, like Saroyan and Bufano, didn't get a place
      on this list.</p>

    <p><sup>2</sup>All of these streets in the St. Francis Square cooperative
      housing project, which was founded by the ILWU, are named not after
      people, but ships or boats which were themselves named after people. Two
      of these streets are official city streets, present on DPW maps; the
      others, also footnoted 4, are not on DPW maps, only
      on <a href="https://sfsquarecoop.com/node/32">the co-op's own map</a>,
      and are not signed. One square in St. Francis Square, Mathew Turner
      Square, is named for a person; other streets and squares there have
      people's surnames (including General Banning Lane) or the names of ships
      not named after people. The namesakes of Dickie Square and Samar Lane are
      uncertain.</p>

    <p><sup>3</sup>These names are
      <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Commemorative-Street-Names/rrqx-thab/about_data">honorary</a>,
      meaning that they did not replace the previous names but augmented them,
      and are not registered with the U.S. Post Office. They appear on street
      signs and often on third-party maps, but not in DPW map data (which uses
      the streets' original names).</p>

    <p><sup>4</sup>These streets are on private property and have no official
      status, though they may appear on third-party maps.</p>
