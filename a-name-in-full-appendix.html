    This list includes every street in San Francisco which has the full name of
    the person it commemorates. Namesakes (where known) and locations are given
    for streets which are neither listed in Louis Lowenstein's <u>Streets of

    differ on whether some streets are called "street", "alley", "way" etc.;
    the names given here are those used in the map data published by the San
    Francisco Department of Public Works.<br>

    </div>

    <p>Tandang Sora Street, between 3rd, 4th, Folsom and Harrison, is named for
      the Filipina revolutionary Melchora Aquino, but does not bear her full
      name; "Tandang Sora" is an epithet referring to her advanced age (84) at
      the time of the Phillipine Revolution.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup>Following a proposal by poet and founder of City Lights
      Books Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofjanaprproceed83sanfrich/page/88/mode/2up?view=theater">on January 25, 1988, twelve San Francisco streets or parts of streets were renamed for thirteen artists and writers.</a>

      Ten are listed above. Saroyan and Via Bufano were renamed for William
      Saroyan (oddly omitting his given name, though Lowenstein and many other
      sources incorrectly name the street in full) and Beniamino Bufano. Nobles
      Alley in North Beach was to be renamed for Richard Brautigan, but the
      residents of Nobles Alley objected. Ferlinghetti got his own street, Via
      Ferlinghetti, in 1994, but, like Saroyan and Bufano, didn't get a place
      on this list.</p>

    <p><sup>2</sup>All of these streets in the St. Francis Square cooperative
      housing project, which was founded by the ILWU, are named not after
      people, but ships or boats which were themselves named after people. Two
      of these streets are official city streets, present on DPW maps; the
      others, also footnoted 3, are not on DPW maps, only
      on <a href="https://sfsquarecoop.com/node/32">the co-op's own map</a>,
      and are not signed. Other streets and squares in St. Francis Square have
      people's surnames (including General Banning Lane) or the names of ships
      not named after people. The namesakes of Dickie Square and Samar Lane are
      uncertain.</p>

    <p><sup>3</sup>These streets are signed (whether by the DPW or not) and
      appear on some maps, but do not appear in DPW mapping data so may not
      have the same official status as the other streets listed. Most of these
      names are honorary, meaning that they did not replace the previous names
      but augmented them, and are not registered with the U.S. Post Office.</p>
