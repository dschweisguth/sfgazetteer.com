<h1>The Crookedest Streets in San Francisco</h1>

By <a href="https://schweisguth.org/%7Edave/">Dave Schweisguth</a>

<p>San Francisco has one famous crooked street, Lombard Street, and one or
two others known mostly to locals. Occasionally someone will claim that
Lombard Street isn't really the twistiest. Clearly this issue needs a
definitive treatment.</p>

<p>Like all fundamental questions, this is in part a question of terms.
What does "crookedest" mean? Some reasonable choices are</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of turns</li>
  <li>the total curvature of the turns</li>
  <li>the average sharpness of the turns</li>
  <li>the sharpness of the sharpest turn<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It's protractor time!</p>

<p>If it's quantity you're after, Lombard is it, with more turns and more
total degrees of turn. Vermont has sharper turns, but then again, if
sharpness is your thing, you can't do better than the perfect
180-degree turn that 22nd Street makes at Collingwood. Anyone backing
Vermont will have to come up with a different criterion.</p>

<p>No question, though, that if you need to show your relatives San
Francisco's ruggedness in a short time, you can't beat a drive down
22nd Street, which as well as two twisty spots also includes one of San
Francisco's two steepest blocks, between Church and Vicksburg.</p>
