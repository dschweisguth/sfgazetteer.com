<p>These streets are in the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Streets-Active-and-Retired/3psu-pn9h">San Francisco Dept. of Public Works database</a> but are not identified by street signs. In most cases these streets are also not identified by stamps in the sidewalk. Some exist only in DPW records ("paper streets") and have never been built. Some have been erased by development and still exist only in DPW records. Some had signs in the past but no longer do.</p>

<p>This list omits<p>

<ul>
  <li>The many streets which have one or more signs, but have a block which does not</li>
  <li>Streets which have no names</li>
  <li>Streets whose names seem not to have been officially chosen, such as the numbered roads in Fort Mason and Fort Miley and the many "Access Road"s in Golden Gate Park. (Note also that Rec & Parks, not DPW, chooses street names in parks.) Those included here have found their way onto online maps or otherwise gained some currency.</li>
  <li>Paper streets which are impossible to visit, such as because they've been built over by a freeway or are in the Bay</li>
  <li>Streets in large areas not open to the public, which can't be surveyed: the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard (where only a few street signs remain, and whose streets have been been retired by DPW) and Coast Guard Sector San Francisco on Yerba Buena Island</li>
  <li>Streets in areas being developed, where existing streets may or may not have been erased and new streets may have been planned but not built or signed yet:
    <ul>
      <li>The Oceanwide Center, southwest of First Street between Market and Mission</li>
      <li>The temporary Transbay Terminal, between Howard, Main, Folsom and Beale Streets</li>
      <li>Pier 70 and the Potrero Power Station area</li>
      <li>The Hunters View development, along Middle Point Road</li>
      <li>Balboa Reservoir</li>
      <li>Parts of Treasure Island</li>
      <li>Parts of Yerba Buena Island</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This list relies on on-site observations, and signs are always being added and removed, so it is always likely to be incomplete. Additions and corrections are welcome.</p>
