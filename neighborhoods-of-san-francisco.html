<h1>The Neighborhoods of San Francisco</h1>

<p>I have several collections of notes and photos and such concerning San
Francisco (e.g. this site's <a
href="more-mosaic-sites-in-san-francisco.html">More Mosaic Sites in San
Francisco</a>), all organized by neighborhood. Some of those collections are
large, which made it important to exactly define each neighborhood and to be
able to put them into a consistent order.</p>

<p>Existing maps weren't quite satisfactory. I'd have liked to use some
official city definition of neighborhoods, but those that I found are too high
level, omitting many important neighborhoods. The San Francisco Association of
Realtors' neighborhood map has a good level of detail and is often insightful
about the exact boundaries between neighborhoods, but it skips a few, such as
Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf and the Lower Haight.</p>

<p>So I made my own map, about 90% taken from the SFAR map but with changes and
additions that made sense to me. After several rounds of revision it's
less different from the SFAR map than I'd expected, but I still find it handy
to have my own that I can edit as I need. Here it is in case anyone else
finds it useful.</p>

<p>For posterity, here is the previous version of this map, split into north and south due to an issue with older versions of Google Maps.</p>

<p>I've sometimes found it necessary to delete and recreate a Google map, which unfortunately breaks links to it. I might be able to avoid doing that again, but in any case I'll always have links to the most recent version on this page so you can find it again.</p>
