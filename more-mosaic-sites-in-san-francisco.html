    </span>Lillian Sizemore's <a href="http://sfmosaic.com/guidebook/">Guide
















































      to Mosaic Sites: San Francisco</a> lists and explains dozens of
    publicly accessible murals, buildings and other mosaic sites
    throughout the City. It's a terrific publication; you should go buy
    a copy right now. But even by the Guide's high standards, there are
    many more mosaics around San Francisco that are worth a visit. Not
    only have San Francisco's mosaic artists kept up their output since
    2004, when the first edition of the Guide was printed, there are
    even a few significant works that were missed at the time. We hope
    this little bare-bones catalog will inspire Lillian to revise and
    expand her Guide sometime soon.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://eagerbeagle.com/">Huxley Beagle</a> and I found
    many of the mosaics listed here while walking from our home in the
    southwest Mission District to two different workplaces South of
    Market several times a week in 2006. We joined Jeanne Halpern on her
    mosaic hikes for the Sierra Club. A few mosaic works were even
    installed practically within view of our home. We continued the hunt
    all over San Francisco. Huxley was succeeded by Wallace Beagle and
    Halley Beagle. Here's what we found.<br>
    <br>
    I update this article whenever we find something new. (Just search
    the page to find the new entries. I did say it was a bare-bones
    catalog.)<br>
