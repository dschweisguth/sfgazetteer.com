    Many of San Francisco's some 2,000 streets commemorate historical
    figures. Most such streets are named with only the surnames of their
    namesakes. But about <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="a-name-in-full-appendix.html">seventy-five</a> have the full
    names of the persons they immortalize. (Most of these street names
    were bestowed fairly recently. Perhaps the resounding name of Dr.
    Martin Luther King, Jr., less distinctive when shortened to a mere
    "King", started this trend.) Even this small sampling shows the
    diversity of the distinguished San Franciscans who have been
    immortalized in asphalt.<br>
    <br>
    Where are the following streets located, and whom do they
    commemorate?<br>
    <br>
    1: Charles J. Brenham Place<br>
    2: Walter U. Lum Place<br>
    3: Peter Yorke Way<br>
    4: Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street<br>
    5: Frank Norris Street<br>
    Bonus: Vernon Alley<br>
    <br>
    1: This extension of Seventh Street north of Market is named for San
    Francisco's second and fourth mayor, the only San Francisco mayor to
    serve nonconsecutive terms (though two alcaldes did the same.)
    Before coming to California, Brenham captained a riverboat on the
    Mississippi river. He turned argonaut in 1849, briefly resumed his
    career as a boatman on the Sacramento River, and in 1850 entered San
    Francisco politics. He was elected mayor in 1851 on a
    good-government platform, ousted at the end of 1851 when his Whig
    party refused to participate in a sudden election precipitated by a
    new city charter, and returned to office in yet another election
    only nine months later. In his first term he prominently opposed the
    first Vigilante movement, once single-handedly talking down a lynch
    mob. (Source: Heintz, William F. <i>San Francisco's Mayors.</i>

    2: The first Chinese-American to have a San Francisco street named
    for him, Walter Lum fought his whole life to give Chinese-Americans
    their place in the city and the country. In 1904, he was a founder
    of the Native Sons of the Golden State, later the Chinese-American
    Citizens Alliance. He founded the organization's newspaper, the
    Chinese Times, in 1924, and was its managing editor for 35 years. It
    went on to became the oldest Chinese-language daily in the U.S.
    Walter Lum died in 1961. On April 22, 1985, the Board of Supervisors
    renamed Brenham Place, the street at the west side of Portsmouth
    Square, to Walter U. Lum Place, and renamed Seventh Street North to
    Charles J. Brenham Place. (Sources: <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>,
    Dec. 21, 1961, p. 20 and Jan. 15, 1985, p. 3 and <i>AsianWeek</i>,
    Apr. 26, 1985.)<br>
    <br>
    3: The street named for Father Peter Yorke is well situated --
    across Geary Boulevard from Starr King Way, named for another
    ecclesiastic, and around the corner from both New St. Mary's
    Cathedral and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
    Union headquarters on Franklin Street. A native of Galway, Peter
    Yorke arrived in San Francisco in 1888. Never rising high within the
    church, Yorke applied his considerable energy to working directly
    for the good of his flock. His unrestrained speaking style -- he
    could call his opponents "cads" and "maggots" -- drew crowds and
    made him a popular hero. In the landmark strike of 1901, in which
    San Francisco's drayage companies escalated a minor quarrel over
    some conventioneers' luggage into a city-wide lockout of union
    labor, Yorke preached in the cause of the unions and threatened a
    boycott. Some give him credit for the collapse of the lockout only
    days later.&nbsp; (Source: Brusher, Joseph S. <i>Consecrated
      Thunderbolt.</i> Hawthorne, NJ: J.F. Wagner, 1973.)<br>

    4: Japantown is not the only place where the ups and downs of
    America's relationship with Japan left their mark on San Francisco.
    On December 10, 1941, Air Force Captain Colin P. Kelly Jr.'s B-17
    bomber was severely damaged by Japanese fighters while returning to
    its base in the Phillipines. Kelly ordered the surviving crew to
    bail out while he held the plane steady. All but his copilot
    parachuted to safety before the B-17 exploded and crashed. In 1942
    the City of San Francisco changed the name of Japan Street, a
    one-block street near Second Street between Brannan and Townsend, to
    honor Captain Kelly. (Sources: Frisbee, John L., "Valor: Colin
    Kelly", <i>Air Force</i> 77:6, June 1994, on line at <a

    and San Francisco Board of Supervisors, <i>Journal of Proceedings</i>
    for Feb. 9, 1942, San Francisco: The Board, 1942.)<br>
    <br>
    5: Frank Norris Street, the easternmost block of Austin Street, is
    in Polk Gulch between Polk, Larkin, Sutter and Bush. Born in Chicago
    and buried in Oakland, the writer Frank Norris lived and worked in
    San Francisco. He was one of the first to adapt French naturalism to
    American literature. The street named for him is only a block and a
    half south of where the title character of his best-known novel,
    "McTeague", advertised his "Dental Parlors" with a great golden
    tooth. (Source: Herron, Don. <i>The Literary World of San Francisco
      and its Environs.</i> San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1990.)<br>

    Bonus: Wondering why this name is in a quiz about streets with two
    names? Look again: Vernon Alley, a private way off of Delancey
    Street between Bryant and Brannan, is marvelously named after none
    other than Vernon Alley. This jazz bassist presided over the San
    Francisco scene for more than sixty years. Recruited into Lionel
    Hampton's band in 1939 when Hampton was in town for the World's Fair
    on Treasure Island, Alley went on to play with all of the country's
    top big bands. He was noted for having fought against segregation in
    the City's jazz clubs and in its musicians union. He was also an
    SFSU Hall of Famer and the first black member of the Bohemian Club.
    Vernon Alley died on October 3, 2004. (Sources: <i>San Francisco
